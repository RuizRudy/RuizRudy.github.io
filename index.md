## Welcome

This github page is a demo, an expirement if you will. My real github account will utilize these tricks tho!

### About Me

Simply a CS Student at Boise State University. Check out my awesome code below

```markdown
printf("Hello World!");
```

Awesome, I know. 

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/RuizRudy/RuizRudy.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
